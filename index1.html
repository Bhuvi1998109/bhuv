      <h1 id="B">TREES</h1>
      <i id="F">In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees.<br>
      Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees in the world.<br>
      A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.<br>

          <h1 id="B">EVERGREEN TREES</h1>
       <i id="E">Although
      Evergreen trees, including needle-bearing conifers and broadleaf evergreens, are a welcome sight in any garden because they offer greenery and interest during the dead of winter, when the branches of deciduous trees are bare. In addition to their ornamental value, evergreen trees can serve as windbreaks, privacy screens, and winter shelter for birds and other wildlife. Many conifers also have fragrant foliage and colorful berries, and some broadleaf evergreens will produce showy blossoms and edible fruit.
Perhaps the only downside to some evergreen trees is their size. Certain varieties can grow to towering proportions, quickly overwhelming residential gardens that have limited space. The good news is that many types of evergreen trees have space-saving alternatives that offer all the attributes of their larger cousins but will stay in scale with their surroundings, even when mature. Some dwarf varieties can even be grown in containers if you keep them well pruned. Here are some of our favorite options, chosen for their distinctive foliage, tidy forms, and tolerance to a wide range of growing conditions.<br><br>
TIPS FOR CHOOSING AN EVERGREEN TREE<br>
The size of an evergreen tree at maturity is only one of many factors to consider when choosing the best specimen for your garden. Here are other important parameters you should include in your decision-making process.<br>
<br>
1.Make sure the tree is suitable for your growing zone and climate conditions. While most conifers are very cold hardy, many broadleaf evergreen trees need a warmer Mediterranean or tropical climate in order to survive. It’s also helpful to know the type of soil the tree prefers.<br>
2.Although the size of a tree at maturity is important, so is the growth rate. Some evergreen trees grow very slowly, at a rate of only 6 to 8 inches per year. These slow-growing trees require minimal pruning to control their height and form, but they won’t fill gaps in the garden quickly.<br>
3.Sometimes the width, or spread, of a tree is more important than its height, especially if you’re dealing with a tight, narrow space. Many newer conifers have very slender, columnar forms that take up little square footage in the garden.<br>
4.Because the foliage of an evergreen tree is present year-round, choose a foliage color and texture that will complement your garden in all seasons. Conifers, in particular, offer numerous color options, ranging from silvery blue to bright gold.<br>
5.Also consider the density of the foliage, especially if you plan to use evergreen trees to create a windbreak or privacy screen. Conifers tend to be better-suited for these applications because of their tiered branches and feathery needles <br>

    <h1 id="B">FLOWERING TREES</h1>
 <i id="F">
  Flowering trees are a great way to add a pop of color and texture to any landscape. Regardless of your growing zone or the conditions you have available, there is a flowering tree out there for any kind of environment. Here are 29 varieties of flowering trees that will brighten up your yard. <br>
  Star Magnolia:<br>
  Star Magnolia (Magnolia stellata) is one of the first plants to bloom in the spring, with white star-shaped flowers that appear in March and April, before the leaves appear. This is a large shrub that grows up to 24 feet tall, but it can be trained as a tree by pruning to retain a single stem to serve as the trunk. 
<br>
Name: Star Magnolia (Magnolia stellata)<br>
USDA Hardiness Zones: 4-9<br>
Flower Color: Red, pink, yellow, white, purple<br>
Light: Full sun to part shade<br>
Soil Needs: Moist but well-drained, loamy<br>
Mature Size: 15-20 ft. tall, 15 ft. wide<br>

    <i id="E" > Plants play a vital role in the maintenance of life on Earth. All energy used by living organisms depends on the complex process of photosynthesis, which is mostly carried out by green plants. Radiant energy from the Sun is transformed into organic chemical energy in the form of sugars through the fundamental series of chemical reactions constituting photosynthesis. In nature all food chains begin with photosynthetic autotrophs (primary producers), including green plants and algae. Primary producers, represented by trees, shrubs, and herbs, are a prolific source of energy in the form of carbohydrates (sugars) stored in the leaves. These carbohydrates, produced in photosynthesis, are broken down in a process called respiration; the smaller units of the sugar molecule and its products fuel numerous metabolic processes. Various parts of the plant (e.g., leaves) are the energy sources that support animal life in different community habitats. A by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen, is essential to animals.
